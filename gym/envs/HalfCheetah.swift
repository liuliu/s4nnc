/// ### Description
/// This environment is based on the work by P. Wawrzy≈Ñski in
/// ["A Cat-Like Robot Real-Time Learning to Run"](http://staff.elka.pw.edu.pl/~pwawrzyn/pub-s/0812_LSCLRR.pdf).
/// The HalfCheetah is a 2-dimensional robot consisting of 9 links and 8
/// joints connecting them (including two paws). The goal is to apply a torque
/// on the joints to make the cheetah run forward (right) as fast as possible,
/// with a positive reward allocated based on the distance moved forward and a
/// negative reward allocated for moving backward. The torso and head of the
/// cheetah are fixed, and the torque can only be applied on the other 6 joints
/// over the front and back thighs (connecting to the torso), shins
/// (connecting to the thighs) and feet (connecting to the shins).
/// ### Action Space
/// The action space is a `Box(-1, 1, (6,), float32)`. An action represents the torques applied between *links*.
/// | Num | Action                                  | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Unit         |

/// ### Observation Space
/// Observations consist of positional values of different body parts of the
/// cheetah, followed by the velocities of those individual parts (their derivatives) with all the positions ordered before all the velocities.
/// By default, observations do not include the x-coordinate of the cheetah's center of mass. It may
/// be included by passing `exclude_current_positions_from_observation=False` during construction.
/// In that case, the observation space will have 18 dimensions where the first dimension
/// represents the x-coordinate of the cheetah's center of mass.
/// Regardless of whether `exclude_current_positions_from_observation` was set to true or false, the x-coordinate
/// will be returned in `info` with key `"x_position"`.
/// However, by default, the observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(17,)` where the elements correspond to the following:
/// | Num | Observation                          | Min  | Max | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Unit                     |

/// ### Rewards
/// The reward consists of two parts:
/// - *forward_reward*: A reward of moving forward which is measured
/// as *`forward_reward_weight` * (x-coordinate before action - x-coordinate after action)/dt*. *dt* is
/// the time between actions and is dependent on the frame_skip parameter
/// (fixed to 5), where the frametime is 0.01 - making the
/// default *dt = 5 * 0.01 = 0.05*. This reward would be positive if the cheetah
/// runs forward (right).
/// - *ctrl_cost*: A cost for penalising the cheetah if it takes
/// actions that are too large. It is measured as *`ctrl_cost_weight` *
/// sum(action<sup>2</sup>)* where *`ctrl_cost_weight`* is a parameter set for the
/// control and has a default value of 0.1
/// The total reward returned is ***reward*** *=* *forward_reward - ctrl_cost* and `info` will also contain the individual reward terms
/// ### Starting State
/// All observations start in state (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
/// 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,) with a noise added to the
/// initial state for stochasticity. As seen before, the first 8 values in the
/// state are positional and the last 9 values are velocity. A uniform noise in
/// the range of [-`reset_noise_scale`, `reset_noise_scale`] is added to the positional values while a standard
/// normal noise with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of `reset_noise_scale` is added to the
/// initial velocity values of all zeros.
/// ### Episode End
/// The episode truncates when the episode length is greater than 1000.
/// ### Arguments
/// No additional arguments are currently supported in v2 and lower.
/// ```
/// env = gym.make('HalfCheetah-v2')
/// ```
/// v3 and v4 take gym.make kwargs such as xml_file, ctrl_cost_weight, reset_noise_scale etc.
/// ```
/// env = gym.make('HalfCheetah-v4', ctrl_cost_weight=0.1, ....)
/// ```

/// ### Version History
/// * v4: all mujoco environments now use the mujoco bindings in mujoco>=2.1.3
/// * v3: support for gym.make kwargs such as xml_file, ctrl_cost_weight, reset_noise_scale etc. rgb rendering comes from tracking camera (so agent does not run away from screen)
/// * v2: All continuous control environments now use mujoco_py >= 1.50
/// * v1: max_time_steps raised to 1000 for robot based tasks. Added reward_threshold to environments.
/// * v0: Initial versions release (1.0.0)
